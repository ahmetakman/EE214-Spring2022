\section{Step 6}
In this step necessary simulations are made.

\subsection{a.}
The  circuit given in Figure 1 is simulated in LTSpice simulation environment as given in Figure 5.

\subsubsection{iii.}
Similarly for the square wave input with the response of our bandpass filter is obtained as given in Figure 13.

\section{Conclusion}
In this preliminary document the characteristics of the filter topologies are investigated.
\section*{Appendix A}
The results of the some of the simulations are fetched from LTSpice and plotted in MATLAB in order to make the plots more readable and convenient.
