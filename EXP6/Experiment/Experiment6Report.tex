\section{Introduction}
In this experiment, Frequency Response, 4 different setups of filter circuits will be experimented with. First, ahighpass filter with a resistor and a capacitor will be set and its characartheristics will be observed. Then a lowpass filter with an inductor and a resistor will be constructed and its behaviour will be observed. A high-q RLC bandpass filter will be set and its quality factor will be determined. Lastly, a square wave applied to band pass and a half rectified sinusoidal is filtered. As a result the waves that are included in a signal needed to be observed.
\section{Experimental Results and Discussion}
The results of the experiment are discussed in the following steps.

\subsection{Step 1}
\subsubsection{a.}

\subsubsection{b.}

\subsection{Step 2}
In this step the circuit given in Figure X is constructed. The switch was kept open.

    \caption{Circuit schematic for the step 2}
\end{figure} 
Then similar to the previous step, a test flow on the BenchVue is ran. Then the outputs of the test flow is exported as a MATLAB data file. The data is imported in MATLAB .The plots of phase response and magnitude response is plotted which are given in Figures X and X.

    \caption{Magnitude Response of the Low-Q RL filter.}
\end{figure} 
The value fo the \(\omega_c\) is pinned in the magnitude response plot. As a result it can be concluded that the circuit is an example of a passive low pass filter. Low pass filters allow only the frequencies below the thereshold.  By looking at the sharpness of the responses it can be said that the Q (the quality factor) of the circuit is low. 
    
\subsection{Step 3}
In this step the circuit given in Figure X is set on the breadboard. The C value is taken as 0.01\(\mu F\) as it was found in the preliminary work.

\end{figure} 
Then similar to the previous steps the test flow on BenchVue is ran. As a result the magnitude and the phase responses given in Figures X and X are obtained. 
file. The data is imported in MATLAB .The plots of phase response and magnitude response is plotted which are given in Figures X and X.

    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{3_1_1.png}
    \caption{Magnitude Response of the High-Q RLC filter.}
\end{figure} 
The values \(\omega_{c1}\) ,\(\omega_{0}\) and \(\omega_{c2}\)  are indicated in the magnitude response plot with data pins. This filter is a band pass filter that only allows certain band of freqencies to pass on. The Q (Quality Factor) of the filter is calculated as 3.821 which can be consired as a high Q.  This also intuitively gives an idea on the sharpness of the phase angle plot.

\section{Conclusion}
In this experiment, Frequency Response, 4 different setups of filter circuits are experimented with. First, a highpass filter with a resistor and a capacitor is set and its characartheristics are observed. Then a lowpass filter with an inductor and a resistor is constructed and its behaviour is observed. A high-q RLC bandpass filter will be set and its quality factor is determined. Lastly, a square wave applied to band pass and a half rectified sinusoidal is filtered. As a result the waves that are included in a oblique signal are observed.
