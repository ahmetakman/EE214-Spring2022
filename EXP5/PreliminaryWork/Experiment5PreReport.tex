\section{Step 1}
The document entitled "Notes on Transistors" read.
\section{Step 2}
One can check whether the a known transistor is defective or not by connecting the probes of the multimeter to the p--->n directions of the transistor . So that if the pn junction is operating one can say transistor is not defective. On the other hand given an unknown transistors is not defective one can determine whether it is npn or pnp by the same featre of the multimeter.
\section{Step 3}
 
\section{Conclusion}
In this preliminary work document. Neccesssary simuloations concerning complex power are done and plotted. Then some of the measurement techniques for the capacitance , inductance and impedance are examined.

\section*{Appendix A}
The results of the simulations are fetched from LTSpice and plotted in MATLAB in order to make the plots more readable and convenient.
