\section{Introduction}
In this document we present our work done to satisfy the requirements of the Term Project of EE214 laboratory course. Accord,ng to the project description we are supposed to make a transmitter which produces different frequency tones (pure sinusoids) and collect them together, and a receiver which can be tuned to these frequencies. The received tone will be played with a speaker.
So, in order to overcome the challange of generating sinusoids with needed frequencies the square wave generator circuits are used. In the receiver unit , the bandpass filter with topology called dual-opamp is used as planned in the Preliminary Report. For the speaker unit a simple opamp amplifier is utilized.
