\section{Step 3}
%MATLAB and Latex
In this step characteristics of linear modeled junction diodes are analyzed according to the I vs V equation as follows,
\[
I  = I_s[e^\frac{qV}{nkT} - 1]    
\] 
Ideality constant n is taken 1 for both cases. From explanation in the manual \(\frac{kT}{q}\) is taken as 25 mV at temperature (20\(\circ\)C ) . The common pievewise linear model for a junction diode is given in Figure 1.

\subsection{a)}
In table 1 the i-v values for the given voltages are obtained by taking the reverse saturation value 2.5xE-7 . The results are calculated using MATLAB.

   \caption{Half-wave circuit schematic for the Step 4}
\end{figure} 
Then the following analysis ,given in Figure 5, is made on paper with the required sketch. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Q4.jpg}
   \caption{Half-wave circuit analysis for the Step 4}
\end{figure} 
Here , \(\alpha\) denotes the difference between the peaks of the \(v_o\) and \(v_i\) which is resulted from the forward resistance of the diode.
So ;
\[
    \alpha = V_i* \frac{r_f}{r_f + R }     
\]
The derived expression for the average voltage is given in the Figure 5. The assumption is made that backward resistance is negligible.
\section{Step 5}
%Hand
 In step 5 the diode clamper circuit is analyzed. The circuit schematic given in Figure 6 is taken as the reference.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{5_1.png}
   \caption{Diode clamper circuit schematic for the Step 5}
\end{figure}

    \centering
   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{5SCH.png}
   \caption{Diode clamper circuit simulation schematic for the Step 5}
\end{figure} 



\subsection{a)}
First, the input is adjusted as a sine wave with amplitude 10 Volts. Then the plot given in Figure 8 is obtained.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{5a.png}
   \caption{Diode clamper circuit simulation plot}
\end{figure} 
As it can be observed the average value of the voltage across diode is appriximately -10 Volts.
\subsection{b)}
Secondly, the input is adjusted as a square wave with 10 Volts. Then the plot given in Figure 9 is obtained.

\section{Step 6}
For step 6 , the half wave rectifier circuit with a capacitive load is used the reference circuit is given in Figure 10. Also note that the plots wanted in the summary are given in Appendix B  ( \pageref{AB} ).

   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{6SCH.png}
   \caption{Half-wave rectifier circuit simulation schematic for the Step 6}
\end{figure} 



\subsection{a)}
Here it is expected to find the value of Resistor which makes \(V_r\) value less than the 1 percent of the output voltage. Since output voltage can be approximated as equal to the input voltage, the deviation is needed to be in 0.1 Volts range. So, if the R value is selected as 1k\(\Omega\)  the requirement is barely become satisfied. 

\subsection{b)}
As a result of the simulation work, the plot in Figure 12 is obtained.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{6.png}
   \caption{Half wave rectifier circuit simulation plot \(V_o\) }
\end{figure} 



\subsection{c)}
%%%% TODO TODO TODO TODO
As done in the Step 4, it can be said that \(V_r\) become equal to the \(V_{peak}\) . Also by the calculations mentioned in the Step 4 (assuming diode is ideal) \(V_{DC}\) becomes \[V_{DC} = \frac{1}{20 \pi^2}\]
\section{Step 7}
