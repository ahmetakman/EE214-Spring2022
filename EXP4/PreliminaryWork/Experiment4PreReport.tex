%\section{Introduction}
\section{Step 1}
The document entitled,  "Supplementary Notes on Transformers", is studied.
\section{Step 2}
The document entitled,  "Introduction to MATLAB", is studied.

\section{Conclusion}
In this preliminary work document. Necessary documents are studied. Then it is observed how one can represent a square wave as the sum of different sine waves.

\iffalse
\section*{Appendix A}
The results of the simulations are fetched from LTSpice and plotted in MATLAB in order to make the plots more readable and convenient.
