\section{Step 2}
To determine a method to measure the unknown capacitance value C, the circuit given in Figure 8 needed to be constructed.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{2SCH.png}
    \caption{Proposed circuit for Capacitance measurement}
\end{figure} 
Now let us derive the expression for capacitance;


\begin{align*}
    \begin{array}{l}
        V_c(t) = V_m cos(\omega t+ \phi )  \: \Rightarrow  in \: phasors \:  V_m \: \phase {\phi} \\ \\
        i_c(t) = CDV_c(t) = CV_m(-\omega) sin(\omega t + \phi) \\ \\
       = -C\omega V_m cos(\omega t + \phi -90) \\ \\
       =-C\omega V_m \phase {\phi - 90\circ} \\ \\
       V_{in} = V_i  \phase{-90\circ} \\ \\
       Z = \frac{V_c}{I_c} = \frac{V_{in} \phase{\phi}}{ - C \omega V_m \phase{\phi -90 \circ}} = \frac{\phase{90\circ}}{-C\omega} = \frac{J}{-C\omega}  = \frac{1}{j\omega C} \\
       \\
       |Z| = \frac{V}{A} =  \frac{1}{C\omega} \Rightarrow C = \frac{A}{V\omega}
    \end{array}
\end{align*}

\section{Step 3}
To determine a method to measure the unknown inductance value L, the circuit given in Figure 9 needed to be constructed.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{3SCH.png}
\caption{Proposed circuit for inductance measurement}
\end{figure} 
Now let us derive the expression for inductance;


\begin{align*}
    \begin{array}{l}
        V_{in}(t) = V_i cos(\omega t+ -90 )  \: \Rightarrow  in \: phasors \:  V_in \: \phase {-90} \\ \\
        Z_L = r + j\omega L \Rightarrow |Z_L| = \sqrt{r^2+\omega^2 L^2} = \frac{V_{rms}}{I_{rms}} \\ \\
        I^2 \omega^2 L^2 = V^2 - I^2 r^2 \\
        So;  \: L = \frac{\sqrt{V_{rms}^2 -  I_{rms}^2 r^2}}{I_{rms} \omega}
    \end{array}
\end{align*}

\section{Step 4}
In this step the circuit schematic given in Figure 10 is the reference.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{4.png}
\caption{Circuit for impedance measurement}
\end{figure} 
\subsection{1st Method}
In first method, the terminal A is denoted as channel 1 and terminal C is denoted as channel 2, terminal B is ground. Here, by inverting the channel 2 in XY mode one can obtain the impedance by dividing the slope by 10. The important thing here is in the signal supply is grounded this method would not work.
\subsection{2nd Method}
In the second method, the terminal A is denoted as channel 1 and terminal B is denoted as channel 2, terminal C is ground. Here one can measure the current by simply dividing the channel 2 by 10 and find the impedance by dividing the channel 1 by the current found. Since it is assumed 10ohm is much smaller than the impedance we could take channel 2 directly. This method can be applied in time mode and phase can be obtained from the measure mode of the DSO directly.

\section{Conclusion}
In this preliminary work document. Neccesssary simuloations concerning complex power are done and plotted. Then some of the measurement techniques for the capacitance , inductance and impedance are examined.

\section*{Appendix A}
The results of the simulations are fetched from LTSpice and plotted in MATLAB in order to make the plots more readable and convenient.
